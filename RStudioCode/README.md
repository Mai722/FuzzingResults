# Results analysis

RStudio was used to analyze the results visually. For this purpose, the CSV files have been uploaded using the codes in this directory to obtain the graphs.

In order to use them, it is necessary to run the buildresults.R file first since it has not been possible to upload the results.csv file used in the generation of different graphs (it exceeds the maximum size). This file will be used to generate and save the results.csv file.

In addition, it must be taken into account that it will be necessary to change the source path of the file to be uploaded in each of the files.
